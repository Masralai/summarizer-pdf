## üöÄ Get Started

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the PDF Summarizer on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v14 or higher (for frontend)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for frontend package management)
- **Python**: v3.8 or higher (for backend)
- **pip** (Python package manager, usually comes with Python)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-summarizer.git
   cd pdf-summarizer
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**

   ```bash
   # Navigate into the backend directory
   cd backend

   # Create a Python virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Download necessary NLTK data (punkt for tokenization, stopwords for filtering)
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"

   # Start the Flask development server
   python app.py
   ```

   The backend API will be accessible at: `http://localhost:5000`

3. **Frontend Setup:**

   ```bash
   # Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory
   cd frontend

   # Install Node.js dependencies
   npm install
   # OR
   yarn install

   # Start the Next.js development server
   npm run dev
   # OR
   yarn dev
   ```

   The frontend application will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Utilized

This project leverages a modern and robust tech stack for both its frontend and backend components.

### Frontend (User Interface)

- **React 18+**: The core library for building dynamic user interfaces with Hooks.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and enhances code quality and maintainability.
- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for production-ready applications, enabling Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and routing.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent UI development.

### Backend (API & NLP Processing)

- **Flask**: A lightweight and flexible Python web framework.
- **PyPDF2**: Used for efficient extraction of text content from PDF documents.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Essential for tokenization, stop word removal, and other NLP tasks.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides robust implementations for machine learning algorithms, specifically for TF-IDF calculation.
- **NumPy**: Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, underpinning Scikit-learn.
- **Flask-CORS**: Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend to communicate with the backend.

## üß† Summarization Algorithms Explained

Each algorithm offers a unique approach to condensing text, making them suitable for different types of documents and desired summary characteristics.

| Algorithm           | How it Works                                                                                                                                      | Best Suited For                                                  | Speed              | Quality              |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------- |
| **Frequency-Based** | Ranks sentences based on the frequency of important words.                                                                                        | General articles, quick overviews.                               | ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° (Fast)      | ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Basic)         |
| **TF-IDF**          | Evaluates word importance by comparing term frequency in a document to its inverse document frequency across a corpus.                            | Technical documents, research papers, specialized content.       | ‚ö°‚ö° (Moderate)    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Good)        |
| **TextRank**        | A graph-based ranking algorithm (like PageRank for text) that identifies central sentences based on their semantic similarity to other sentences. | Complex documents, highly interconnected ideas, narrative texts. | ‚ö° (Comprehensive) | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Excellent) |
